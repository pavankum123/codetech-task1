### Objective
Introduce and demonstrate fundamental concepts of embedded systems and microcontroller programming. 
Learn the syntax and structure of Arduino code, including functions like setup(), loop(), and how to control hardware with digitalWrite() and delay().
Understand how to set up digital pins as either inputs or outputs using pinMode().

### Key Activities
**Circuit Setup**: Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to a digital output pin on the Arduino
**Write Arduino Code**: In the setup() function, use pinMode() to set the LED pin as an output.
**Upload the Code**: Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB and select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE and click the Upload button to send the code to the Arduino.
**Debugging**: If the LED does not blink, check the wiring and ensure the code is correct.

### Technologies Used
**Arduino Microcontroller**: The Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) is the primary platform for programming and controlling the hardware. It executes the code written in the Arduino IDE and controls the LED.
**Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: he Arduino IDE is used to write, compile, and upload the code to the Arduino board. It provides a user-friendly interface for programming and debugging.
**Embedded Programming**: he Arduino programming language is based on C/C++, and is used to program the microcontroller for controlling the LED. It includes functions like digitalWrite(), pinMode(), and delay().
**Power Supply**: The Arduino is powered either through USB or an external power source (e.g., a battery or adapter).
